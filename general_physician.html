<span>Consultant Physician </span>
</h2>
<p>Consultant Physician are highly trained specialists/doctors who provide non-surgical healthcare to patients. Their duties include caring for difficult, serious, or unusual medical problems. A Consultant Physician is supposed to continue seeing a patient until his/her problems resolve or stabilize.</p>
<p>It is their versatile range of expertise that differentiate Consultant Physician from other specialists that limit their medical practice to problems involving only one body system or to a special area of medical knowledge. While most of the work of a Consultant Physician takes place with hospitalised patients, some of them also simultaneously see new patients in their consulting rooms.</p>
<h4>
<strong>Why visit a Consultant Physician? What does a Consultant Physician do?</strong>
</h4>
<p>Like you read above, a Consultant Physician is a medical doctor who specialises in many diseases affecting the body but whose primary treatment does not involve surgery. This means that for any health issues that you face, you can consult a Consultant Physician.</p>
<p>A Consultant Physician is normally the first point of contact for anyone with a physical or mental health problem. Sometimes patients reach out to them at an early stage but mostly, they reach out at their most anxious stage. Consultant Physician have a vital role in looking after patients in their homes and within the communities. Their major role includes promoting, preventing, and initiating treatment. Their duties also include looking after patients with chronic illness, with the aim to keep people in their own homes with a proper health and wellness.</p>
<p>A vital part of their role also includes looking after the whole person - physically, emotionally, socially, spiritually, culturally and economically via patient-centred approaches. The role of a Consultant Physician is also becoming more important with terminally ill patients who often choose to stay at home.</p>

<h4>
<strong>What should you expect when you visit a Consultant Physician?</strong>
</h4>
<p>Normally, a Consultant Physician schedules a short time with their patients. So, in order to get the best out of their time and yours, you must go prepared. Here&rsquo;s what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 8.7pt;">Make notes about the specific symptoms you are experiencing. This will help them in recording how long they lasted and what you were doing right before you felt them.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 8.7pt;">Make a list of questions and be sure to list the important ones first.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 8.7pt;">Think about your medical history and prior illnesses that run in the family. Ask other family members if you don&rsquo;t know.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 8.7pt;">Write down your medications and dosage. Include over-the-counter medication like vitamins and herbal remedies as well.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 8.7pt;">Take reports from your recent tests.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 8.7pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
<strong>What should you ask your Consultant Physician?</strong>
</h4>
<p>You should share every information about your illness or condition with the Consultant Physician. From the symptoms, you are facing the problems you are experiencing.</p>
<p>Once you share all this relevant information with your Consultant Physician, he will form a diagnosis of your disease or illness based on the provided information. Once the diagnosis has been framed, you should consult every query related to your disorder with the physician. You can openly discuss the causes, the type of treatment, precautions required, how long it would last and what effects it will be having on your body. You can also consult about the preventive measures to avoid future occurrences of the disorder.</p>
<h4>
<strong>How often should you consult or visit your Consultant Physician?</strong>
</h4>
<p>People generally visit their Consultant Physician only when they suffer from some kind of illness like fever, cold, cough, diarrhoea or any other such forms of acute or chronic illnesses. But they should try to visit their Consultant Physician for routine or regular checkups. Visits to a Consultant Physician should be paid for sugar, BP, thyroid and overall fitness checkups. This helps to ensure your overall physical wellness and prevents you from the risk of developing any kind of serious disorder.</p>
<p>The routine checkups can be conducted at least once a month or as is advised by your Consultant Physician. Your medical history should also be analyzed while conducting such checkups.</p>
<h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Analysis </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you visit a Consultant Physician, he may ask you about the symptoms and the conditions that you are facing. Depending on the type of ailment, he may also examine your medical history or your previous medical reports. In some cases, he may also conduct certain tests, like a blood test, X-ray, urine test and other tests of similar nature. He may also ask you about your family history.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Framing a Diagnosis</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on his analysis of your physical condition, symptoms, and test reports he will frame a detailed diagnosis of your underlying condition or illness.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Writing Prescriptions</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Consultant Physician will then suggest or write you a certain prescription depending on your illness or disorder. Some prescriptions are short-term and are to be taken for 3 to 4 days while some others are long-term depending on the severity of your ailment. Your Consultant Physician may also provide you with general guidance on the precautions and the preventive measures you need to take during your treatment. He may ask you to avoid certain food items or things you are allergic to, in case of a bacterial infection. He can also suggest the consumption of light meals and other preventive measures.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>General Guidance</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even after you recover from your ailment, you can still visit your Consultant Physician for a routine checkup or for seeking general medical guidance.</p>
